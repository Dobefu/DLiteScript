## What is DLiteScript?

DLiteScript is a delightfully simple scripting language,
built to be very easy to learn and pick up.

The syntax resembles that of Go, and takes inspiration from many other languages.
Though the syntax is very simple, it is still a statically typed language.
This helps catch errors at the time of writing,
allowing you to run the code with the peace of mind that type errors are taken care of.
