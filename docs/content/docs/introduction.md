## What is DLiteScript?

DLiteScript is a delightfully simple scripting language, built to be very easy to learn and pick up.
The syntax resembles that of Go, and takes inspiration from many other languages.
Though the syntax is very simple, it is still a statically typed language.
This helps catch errors at the time of writing, instead of at runtime.

## Philosophy

- There should be no "magic", everything should be visible and explicit.
- Weak typing may seem simple, but it introduces a lot of complexity and bugs.
- Errors aren't edge cases, just another possible state of a program.
- Tooling should be a part of the language, not an afterthought.
- To ensure consistency, the standard library should cover most use cases.
