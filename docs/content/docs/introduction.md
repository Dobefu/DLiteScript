## What is DLiteScript?

DLiteScript is a delightfully simple scripting language, built to be very easy to learn and pick up.
The syntax resembles that of Go, and takes inspiration from many other languages.

## Philosophy

- There should be no "magic", everything should be visible and explicit.
- Weak typing may seem simple, but it introduces a lot of complexity and bugs.
- Errors aren't edge cases, just another possible state of a program.
- Tooling should be a part of the language, not an afterthought.
- To ensure consistency, the standard library should cover most use cases.
